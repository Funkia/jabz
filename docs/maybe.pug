    Type of maybe values.

     Pattern matching on `Maybe` values. `MaybeMatch<A, K>` must be a
     object with a `nothing` and `just` properties containing
     functions that returns `K`.

     maybeAge.match({
       just: (n) => `You're ${n} years old'`,
       nothing: () => `No age provided :(`
     });

    p Creates a Maybe with just the value a.

+fn('fromMaybe', '<A>(a: A, m: Maybe<A>): A')
  div.description
    p Extracts a the potential value from `m` with `a` as a fallback.

      If `m` is `nothing` return `b`. Otherwise, extract the value, pass it through `f` and return it.
