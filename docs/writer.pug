h3#writer Writer

:markdown-it

  The `Writer` monad represents computation that produces a value and
  write to a shared state.

  The `Writer` monad is useful in cases where functions produce a
  "primary" output but alongside that also need to append values to a
  shared state. This shared state is a monoid.

  A value of type `Writer<A, B>` is a computation that produces a
  value of type `B` and produces a monoid value of type `A` as a
  secondary output.

  In the example below the functions `divide` and `add` does
  arithmetic but besides that they also produce strings for a log.

  ```javascript
  const {tell} = createWriter(String);
  const divide = fgo(function*(n, m) {
    yield tell(`Divide ${n} by ${m}. `);
    return n / m;
  });
  const add = fgo(function*(n, m) {
    yield tell(`Add ${n} to ${m}. `);
    return n + m;
  });
  const comp = go(function*() {
    const a = yield add(12, 8);
    const b = yield divide(132, 11);
    return yield add(a, b);
  });
  runWriter(comp);
  //=> ["Add 12 to 8. Divide 132 by 11. Add 20 to 12. ", 32];
  ```

+fn('createWriter', '<M extends Monoid<M>>(mc: MonoidDictionary<M>): WriterFunctions<M>')
  :markdown-it
    Creates a writer monad from a monoid dictionary.

+fn('tell', '<A>(w: W): Writer<W, {}>')
  :markdown-it
    Returns a `Writer` action that produces no value but combines the
    shared monoid with `w`.

+fn('listen', '<A>(w: Writer<W, A>): Writer<W, [A, W]>')

+fn('runWriter', '<W extends Monoid<W>, A>(w: Writer<W, A>): [W, A]')
  :markdown-it
    Runs the `Writer` monad and returns a pair of the monoid value and
    the final result.
