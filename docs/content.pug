      p A semigroup represents things that can be combined. That is, two objects of the same semigroups can be combined into one object of the semigroup. In other words semigroups are things that can be composed.
      p Examples are many. For instance numbers can be combined by adding them together, lists can be combined by concatenating them and images can be combined by overlaying them.
